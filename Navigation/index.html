                    <strong>Travel</strong> is the movement of people between distant geographical
                    locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus,
                    airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1]
                    Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of
                    tourism.

                    The <strong>Party</strong> was the first since the pandemic, yet because we waited for it,
                        more of us were in good enough health, with good enough lungs and energy levels, to party all
                        night long.

                    <strong>Food</strong>, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and other
                    nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish
                    energy. The absorption and utilization of food by the body
                    is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion.
